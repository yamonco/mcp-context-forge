Upstream MCP session registry (1:1 per downstream session).
Replaces the previous ``SessionAffinity`` which keyed upstream sessions by
``(user_identity, url, identity_hash, transport_type, gateway_id)``. That
sharing leaked state between downstream MCP sessions whose callers happened
to share the same identity (issue #4205): two chat tabs opened by the same
user would receive the same counter state, because both were wired to the
same pooled upstream session.
This registry enforces 1:1 binding between a downstream MCP session (as
identified by its ``Mcp-Session-Id``) and each upstream gateway it talks to.
Within one downstream session, tool calls still reuse a single upstream
session per gateway — so the per-call latency win of pooling survives — but
nothing is ever shared across downstream sessions.

    Calls through one reused MCP SDK ClientSession are serialized. The SDK
    request-id counter is not locked, so concurrent send_request() calls can
    reuse an id and deliver a resources/read response to a tools/call waiter.

    The registry is purely in-process. Multi-worker stickiness for a given
