HTTP Header Passthrough Utilities.
This module provides utilities for handling HTTP header passthrough functionality
in ContextForge. It enables forwarding of specific headers from incoming
client requests to backing MCP servers while preventing conflicts with
existing authentication mechanisms.

Key Features:
- Global configuration support via environment variables and database
- Per-gateway header configuration overrides
- Intelligent conflict detection with existing authentication headers
- Security-first approach with explicit allowlist handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Header validation and sanitization

The header passthrough system follows a priority hierarchy:
1. Gateway-specific headers (highest priority)
2. Global database configuration
3. Environment variable defaults (lowest priority)

Example Usage:
    See comprehensive unit tests in tests/unit/mcpgateway/utils/test_passthrough_headers*.py
    for detailed examples of header passthrough functionality.

    """Get headers that should be passed through to the target gateway.

    This function implements the core logic for HTTP header passthrough in ContextForge.
    It determines which headers from incoming client requests should be forwarded to
    backing MCP servers based on configuration settings and security policies.

    Configuration Priority (highest to lowest):
    1. Gateway-specific passthrough_headers setting
    2. Global headers from get_passthrough_headers() based on PASSTHROUGH_HEADERS_SOURCE:
       - "db": Database wins if configured, env var DEFAULT_PASSTHROUGH_HEADERS as fallback
       - "env": Environment variable always wins, database ignored
       - "merge": Union of both sources (DB casing wins for duplicates)

    Security Features:
    - Feature flag control (disabled by default)
    - Prevents conflicts with existing base headers (e.g., Content-Type)
    - Blocks Authorization header conflicts with gateway authentication
    - Header name validation (regex pattern matching)
    - Header value sanitization (removes dangerous characters, enforces limits)
    - Logs all conflicts and skipped headers for debugging
    - Uses case-insensitive header matching for robustness
    - Special X-Upstream-Authorization handling: When gateway uses auth, clients can
      send X-Upstream-Authorization header which gets renamed to Authorization for upstream

    Args:
        request_headers (Dict[str, str]): Headers from the incoming HTTP request.
            Keys should be header names, values should be header values.
            Example: {"Authorization": "Bearer token123", "X-Tenant-Id": "acme"}
        base_headers (Dict[str, str]): Base headers that should always be included
            in the final result. These take precedence over passthrough headers.
            Example: {"Content-Type": "application/json", "User-Agent": "MCPGateway/1.0"}
        db (Session): SQLAlchemy database session for querying global configuration.
            Used to retrieve GlobalConfig.passthrough_headers setting.
        gateway (Optional[DbGateway]): Target gateway instance. If provided, uses
            gateway.passthrough_headers to override global settings. Also checks
            gateway.auth_type to prevent Authorization header conflicts.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, str]: Combined dictionary of base headers plus allowed passthrough
            headers from the request. Base headers are preserved, and passthrough
            headers are added only if they don't conflict with security policies.

    Raises:
        No exceptions are raised. Errors are logged as warnings and processing continues.
        Database connection issues may propagate from the db.query() call.
