Per-request scope resolution and Rust-runtime trust-layer helpers.

Purpose (for future implementers)
---------------------------------
``mcpgateway`` keeps token primitives, request scope resolution, and the
trusted Rust-runtime hop in three logical groups, even though only two
modules currently exist:

- ``mcpgateway.auth`` (the larger sibling) - the **token / session / team
  model layer** and the FastAPI auth dependency. Most helpers there are pure
  primitives over stored artifacts (JWT claims, API tokens, revocation
  records, team membership rows) and do not need a ``Request``. The
  request-coupled exceptions are ``get_current_user`` (the FastAPI
  dependency that bridges the two layers) plus a small set of helpers it
  calls into - ``_inject_userinfo_instate`` and ``_propagate_tenant_id`` -
  which stash payload metadata on ``request.state`` for downstream helpers
  here. New code added to ``auth.py`` should follow the pure-primitive
  pattern unless it is part of the dependency chain.

- ``mcpgateway.auth_context`` (this module) - the **per-request scope
  resolution layer** plus the **Rust-runtime trust-header helpers**. The
  scope-resolution helpers take a FastAPI ``Request`` plus the ``user``
  produced by the auth dependency and compute what the caller is allowed
  to see on this specific request - this is Layer 1 in the two-layer model
  documented in ``AGENTS.md`` ("what you can SEE"), distinct from the
  Layer 2 RBAC checks in ``mcpgateway.middleware.rbac`` ("what you can
  DO"). The trust-header helpers (``decode_internal_mcp_auth_context``,
  ``has_valid_internal_mcp_runtime_auth_header``, the
  ``_expected_internal_mcp_runtime_auth_header*`` family) implement the
  HMAC contract between the Rust MCP runtime and the Python gateway. They
  live here, not in ``auth.py``, because the trusted forwarded context
  produces a synthetic ``user`` that the per-request helpers consume; the
  two responsibilities are coupled at the request boundary. A future
  refactor may extract them into a third ``mcpgateway.auth_runtime``
  module if the coupling weakens.

Why this module exists as a separate file
-----------------------------------------
Both ``mcpgateway.main`` and ``mcpgateway.admin`` need the scoped-access
helper to pass ``(user_email, token_teams)`` into the service layer. Before
this split, the helper lived in ``main.py`` and ``admin.py`` reached back
through a lazy import, creating a static cyclic import
(``admin -> main -> admin``) that ``pylint R0401`` flagged. Hoisting the
helper (and its dependency chain) into a sibling module whose only
non-stdlib first-party dependencies are ``mcpgateway.auth`` and
``mcpgateway.config`` breaks the cycle at the architectural level rather
than papering over it with ``# pylint: disable``.

Public surface
--------------
The names below are the **module's public API**. Callers in ``main.py``,
``admin.py``, routers, and transports should use these names.

    Constants (HTTP header names used by the Rust -> Python MCP bridge)
        INTERNAL_MCP_SESSION_VALIDATED_HEADER

    Identity resolution
        get_user_email(user) -> str

    Trust-layer headers forwarded from the Rust MCP runtime
        decode_internal_mcp_auth_context(header_value) -> dict
        get_internal_mcp_auth_context(request) -> dict | None
        has_valid_internal_mcp_runtime_auth_header(request) -> bool

    Per-request JWT / scope resolution (the Layer-1 surface)
        get_token_teams_from_request(request) -> list[str] | None
        get_rpc_filter_context(request, user) -> (email, teams, is_admin)
        get_request_identity(request, user) -> (email, is_admin)
        get_scoped_resource_access_context(request, user) -> (email, teams)

Private surface
---------------
Leading-underscore names below are **implementation helpers private to this
module**. They are not imported from outside and should not be. If you find
yourself needing one from another module, consider whether the calling code
should really go through one of the public wrappers above, or whether the
helper belongs in ``mcpgateway.auth`` instead.

    _INTERNAL_MCP_RUNTIME_AUTH_CONTEXT   (constant string used to derive headers)
    _INTERNAL_MCP_RUNTIME_AUTH_HEADER    (header name consumed by the trust gate)
    _auth_encryption_secret_value        (config-dependent secret accessor)
    _expected_internal_mcp_runtime_auth_header
    _expected_internal_mcp_runtime_auth_header_for_secret
    _has_verified_jwt_payload            (probe used by the resolution helpers)

Security invariants
-------------------
See ``AGENTS.md`` section "Authentication & RBAC Overview" for the full
policy. The key invariants that this module enforces:

1. ``get_token_teams_from_request`` respects the secure-first semantics of
   ``auth.normalize_token_teams``: missing ``teams`` claim means public-only,
   not admin bypass.
2. ``get_rpc_filter_context`` derives ``is_admin`` from the verified JWT
   payload or the trusted internal MCP auth context - NOT from the DB user -
   so a scoped token (``teams=[]``) cannot inherit admin bypass.
3. ``get_scoped_resource_access_context`` returns ``(None, None)`` *only* for
   genuine admin bypass (verified JWT ``is_admin=true`` + ``teams=null``, or
   non-JWT dev-mode admin). Public-only tokens get ``(email, [])``.
   Downstream services MUST treat ``(None, None)`` as "admin bypass; still
   deny private resources" per PR #4341.
4. Non-JWT admin callers (basic-auth / dev mode) keep unrestricted visibility
   via the fallback-admin branch; this carve-out is intentional and documented
   in ``AGENTS.md``.

# The session-affinity Redis pub/sub hop is different: a writer to the Redis
# channel needs no secret, yet the owner worker re-stamps whatever auth context
# it reads with a valid runtime-auth token before dispatching. That makes the
# owner a signing oracle for forged contexts. Signing the auth context alone
# closes the forged-identity oracle, but it does not prove that the verified
# identity belongs to the *operation* being executed: an attacker with Redis
# write access could pair a captured signature with a different method, path,
# body, or response_channel (CWE-347). To close that, the publisher signs the
# whole forwarded envelope (every operation field, including response_channel so
# the response cannot be redirected) and the consumer verifies the envelope
