Shared helpers for the live-gateway cpex plugin E2E suites.

These helpers talk plain HTTP to a running gateway (started by the
plugin-integration.yml workflow with a single-plugin enforce config). They
cover three concerns shared by every plugin suite:

* minting an admin JWT and building API / MCP headers,
* registering the ``fast-time-server`` gateway and provisioning a virtual
  server that exposes its tools, and
* the streamable-HTTP ``initialize`` handshake plus ``tools/call`` round-trip.

The suites never import the cpex plugin package — the gateway loads it from
``PLUGINS_CONFIG_FILE`` — so a broken wheel surfaces as a failing E2E rather
than a silently skipped import.
