# How ContextForge Fits the Criteria for Selecting an Enterprise AI, Agent and MCP Gateway

A practical framework for evaluating MCP gateways, and how ContextForge addresses each criterion.

---

## Why ContextForge?

Organizations deploying AI agents face fragmented tool ecosystems, inconsistent security controls, and no centralized governance across agent interactions. What's needed is a way to federate tools, enforce policy, and deliver visibility across your AI infrastructure. ContextForge addresses this — an open source registry and proxy that centralizes governance, discovery, routing, and observability for MCP, A2A, and REST/gRPC services while optimizing agent and tool calling.

This framework outlines what to evaluate and why each criterion matters.

## MCP Gateway Landscape

The MCP gateway market has matured rapidly. Options range from managed SaaS platforms (Composio, MintMCP, Apigee MCP Hub) to cloud-native solutions (Azure API Management, Docker MCP Toolkit) to self-hosted open source (ContextForge, Lasso Security, Bifrost).

    end

    managed --> |"Lower ops burden<br>Vendor dependency"| decision{Your Choice}
    cloud --> |"Ecosystem lock-in<br>Tight integration"| decision
    selfhosted --> |"Full control<br>Higher ops burden"| decision
```

**Key market distinctions:**

- **Managed platforms** offer lower operational burden but introduce vendor dependency
- **Cloud-native solutions** integrate tightly with specific ecosystems (Azure, Docker)
- **Self-hosted open source** provides maximum control and customization

This framework applies regardless of which path you choose. ContextForge is used as a reference implementation to illustrate what "good" looks like for each criterion.

### About ContextForge

!!! info "Enterprise-Grade by Design"
    ContextForge was designed from the ground up for enterprise AI deployments, not retrofitted from a developer tool or proof-of-concept. Its architecture reflects lessons learned from operating AI infrastructure at scale within IBM, where it powers IBM Consulting Advantage serving 160,000+ users across regulated industries.

**Design principles:**

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Security-first** | Zero-trust architecture, defense-in-depth, no implicit trust between components |
| **Governance by default** | RBAC, audit trails, and policy enforcement enabled out of the box |
| **Observable** | OpenTelemetry instrumentation throughout, not bolted on afterward |
| **Scale-tested** | Connection pooling, multi-tier caching |
| **Air-gap ready** | No telemetry, bundled assets, runs fully disconnected |
| **Open standards** | MCP and A2A protocol compliance, no proprietary extensions |

??? note "Enterprise Validation"

    - Production-hardened through deployment in financial services, healthcare, and government contexts
    - Performance-optimized through iterative load testing (10k+ concurrent users)
    - Security-reviewed by IBM Security Research teams
    - Compliance-aligned with enterprise requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, FedRAMP patterns)

The criteria in this framework reflect what we've learned matters most when deploying MCP infrastructure at enterprise scale.

## Risk & Governance Models

!!! warning "Why MCP Security Differs from Traditional API Security"
    Unlike traditional protocols, MCP places LLMs at the center of execution decisions. The "continuous token stream" nature of LLM processing means untrusted input (tool responses, schema descriptions, resource content) can alter execution flow. This eliminates traditional control/data plane separation and requires fundamentally different threat modeling.

### Tiered Threat Model (CoSAI Framework)

The CoSAI OASIS framework organizes MCP threats into three tiers:

| Tier | Category | Example Threats |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1** | MCP-Specific | Tool poisoning, schema poisoning, typosquatting, shadow MCP servers, overreliance on LLM safety |
| **Tier 2** | MCP-Contextualized | Privilege escalation, consent fatigue, improper multitenancy, invisible agent activity |
| **Tier 3** | Conventional (Amplified) | Credential theft, replay attacks, command injection, data exfiltration, supply chain compromise |

### Agentic System Risk Categories

MCP gateways must address risk vectors across three domains: identity and access, supply chain integrity, and operational governance. Each category demands specific mitigations that traditional API gateways do not provide.

**Identity & Access Risks**

| Threat Vector | Attack Pattern | Gateway Mitigation |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Prompt Injection | Malicious instructions embedded in tool arguments or responses | Payload inspection with safety schema validation; argument sanitization |
| Credential Theft | Agents storing or leaking API keys and tokens | Zero-trust secret injection: gateway manages credentials, agents receive scoped ephemeral tokens |
| Privilege Escalation | Agents acquiring permissions beyond their scope | Task-Based Access Control (TBAC): permissions bound to specific workflows and contexts |
| Session Hijacking | Attackers intercepting agent-to-tool communication | Mutual TLS, signed requests, and session binding with proof-of-possession tokens |

**Supply Chain Risks**

| Threat Vector | Attack Pattern | Gateway Mitigation |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Tool Poisoning | Compromised tools returning malicious responses | Checksum verification, response validation, and behavioral anomaly detection |
| Tool Shadowing | Rogue tools impersonating legitimate ones | Centralized registry as single source of truth; agents discover only vetted tools |
| Dependency Confusion | Typosquatted or substituted tool packages | Package provenance verification, SBOM tracking, and namespace controls |
| Schema Manipulation | Altered tool schemas that change expected behavior | Schema pinning with cryptographic signatures and version control |

**Operational Risks**

| Threat Vector | Attack Pattern | Gateway Mitigation |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Server Sprawl | Unmanaged MCP servers proliferating across the organization | Lifecycle management with automated discovery and shadow server detection |
| Configuration Drift | Inconsistent security policies across deployments | Centralized policy enforcement with GitOps-driven configuration |
| Audit Gaps | Missing or incomplete logs of agent activities | Mandatory structured logging with correlation IDs across the execution chain |
| Quota Exhaustion | Runaway agents consuming excessive resources | Per-agent rate limiting, budget controls, and circuit breakers |

### The Triple Gate Security Pattern

Defense-in-depth architecture requiring controls at three layers:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph gate1["Gate 1: AI Layer"]
        direction TB
        client["AI Client"]
        intent["Intent Classification"]
        filter["Prompt Filtering"]
    end

    subgraph gate2["Gate 2: MCP Layer"]
        direction TB
        gateway["ContextForge"]
        authz["Tool Authorization"]
        validate["Argument Validation"]
    end

    subgraph gate3["Gate 3: API Layer"]
        direction TB
        backend["Backend APIs"]
        rate["Rate Limiting"]
        mtls["mTLS / IP Allow-list"]
    end

    client --> intent --> filter
    filter --> gateway
    gateway --> authz --> validate
    validate --> backend
    backend --> rate --> mtls

```

| Gate | Layer | Focus | Controls |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Gate 1** | AI Layer (Client) | Intent classification | Prompt filtering, malicious instruction prevention |
| **Gate 2** | MCP Layer (Gateway) | Tool authorization | "User A can call Tool B with Argument C" |
| **Gate 3** | API Layer (Backend) | Network security | Rate limiting, mTLS, IP allow-listing |

!!! success "ContextForge Addresses All Three Gates"

    - **Gate 1:** Guardrail plugins for content inspection before tool execution
    - **Gate 2:** Full RBAC with team/tool/server scoping and argument validation
    - **Gate 3:** Backend auth passthrough, rate limiting, and network policy support
    - **Human-in-the-Loop:** MCP elicitation pass-through for server-side user confirmation on risky actions

## 1. Architecture & Protocol Support

??? abstract "What to Evaluate"

    - Gateway role: proxy-only, registry, or full hosting capability
    - Transport support: HTTP, SSE, WebSocket, stdio, streamable HTTP
    - Protocol bridging: REST-to-MCP, gRPC-to-MCP translation
    - Session awareness and context propagation
    - Transport security: payload limits, mTLS, CORS/CSRF protections
    - Message integrity verification

!!! tip "Why It Matters"
    Enterprise environments have diverse backends: legacy REST APIs, gRPC services, and native MCP servers. A gateway that only proxies native MCP leaves significant integration work on the table.

**ContextForge delivers:**

- Full gateway/registry/proxy with tool hosting capabilities
- All major transports: HTTP, JSON-RPC, WebSocket, SSE, stdio, streamable HTTP
- Automatic REST-to-MCP virtualization with JSON Schema extraction
- gRPC-to-MCP translation via server reflection
- Session-aware routing with context propagation across multi-step workflows

```mermaid

    subgraph clients["AI Clients"]
        claude["Claude"]
        openai["OpenAI"]
        custom["Custom Agents"]
    end

    subgraph transports["Transport Layer"]
        sse["SSE"]
        ws["WebSocket"]
        http["Streamable HTTP"]
    end

    gateway["ContextForge<br>Gateway"]

        grpc["gRPC Services"]
        stdio["stdio Servers"]
    end

    clients --> transports --> gateway
    gateway --> backends
```

## 2. Federation & Discovery

??? abstract "What to Evaluate"

    - Multi-server aggregation into unified catalog
    - Health monitoring and automatic failover
    - Cross-region/cluster federation
    - Tool, resource, and prompt discovery
    - Auto-discovery mechanisms (mDNS, service mesh)

!!! tip "Why It Matters"
    Large organizations run tools across teams, regions, and cloud providers. Without federation, each agent needs direct configuration to every backend, creating sprawl and configuration drift.

**ContextForge delivers:**

- Federation across multiple MCP and REST services into a single registry
- Health monitoring with automatic endpoint failover
- Redis-backed multi-cluster federation and caching
- Unified discovery API for tools, resources, and prompts
- Auto-discovery via mDNS for local deployments

---

## 3. Virtual Servers & Tool Composition

??? abstract "What to Evaluate"

    - Ability to create curated tool bundles from multiple backends
    - Per-server authentication and authorization
    - Schema generation and validation
    - Tagging and metadata support

!!! tip "Why It Matters"
    Not every agent needs every tool. Virtual servers enable least-privilege access, exposing only what a specific team, application, or agent requires.

**ContextForge delivers:**

- Virtual MCP servers composing tools from any registered backend
- Per-server custom authentication flows
- Automatic schema generation from composed tools
- Tag-based organization and filtering

---

## 4. Identity & Access Control

??? abstract "What to Evaluate"

    - Enterprise IdP integration (OIDC, SAML)
    - OAuth 2.0/2.1 support with PKCE
    - JWT authentication (symmetric and asymmetric)
    - Fine-grained RBAC: per tool, per server, per team
    - Service-to-service authentication
    - Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)
    - Token exchange (RFC 8693) vs token passthrough
    - Proof-of-possession mechanisms (RFC 9449) to prevent replay
    - End-to-end request traceability across execution chain

!!! tip "Why It Matters"
    Credential sprawl is a primary risk vector. Centralized authentication with proper scoping prevents unauthorized access and simplifies security audits.

**ContextForge delivers:**

- SSO integration: GitHub, Google, Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Keycloak, generic OIDC
- OAuth 2.0 with Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) and PKCE
- On-Behalf-Of (OBO) token exchange support
- RFC 8707 OAuth Resource Indicators for A2A communication
- JWT authentication supporting HS256 and RS256
- Team-scoped RBAC with configurable role hierarchies
- API key management with scoped permissions
- Zero-trust secret injection: agents receive scoped tokens, never raw API keys
- Just-in-time (JIT) access and temporary privilege elevation (roadmap)

---

## 5. Multi-Tenancy & Isolation

??? abstract "What to Evaluate"

    - Tenant/team-scoped resources
    - Catalog isolation per tenant
    - Separate secrets and credential stores
    - External vault integration (HashiCorp Vault, Azure KeyVault, AWS Secrets Manager)
    - Quota and rate limit boundaries per tenant

!!! tip "Why It Matters"
    Platform teams serving multiple business units need strong isolation guarantees. Without it, one team's misconfiguration affects everyone.

**ContextForge delivers:**

- Full multi-tenant architecture with team scoping
- Isolated catalogs per team
- Tenant-scoped API keys and secrets
- Per-team rate limits and quota enforcement
- Resource visibility controls

---

## 6. AI Guardrails & Content Policy

    - Integration with moderation models
    - Policy engine for custom rules
    - Request/response inspection
    - Secrets detection in tool arguments
    - URL reputation checking

!!! tip "Why It Matters"
    AI agents interacting with tools can inadvertently expose or transmit sensitive data. Runtime guardrails provide defense-in-depth beyond model-level safety.

**ContextForge delivers:**

- PII detection with automatic redaction (SSN, credit cards, emails, medical data)
- Content deny lists and regex-based filters
- LlamaGuard and Granite Guardian integration
- OPA and Cedar policy engine integration

**ContextForge delivers:**

- Structured audit logging with correlation IDs
- Full request/response logging with configurable redaction
- Identity attribution across all operations
- Export-ready for SIEM integration
- Retention policy support
- Compliance report generator for FedRAMP/HIPAA/SOC2 (roadmap)

---

## 8. Reliability & Resiliency

??? abstract "What to Evaluate"

    - Retry policies per backend
    - Timeout configuration
    - Circuit breakers and bulkhead isolation
    - Rate limiting and burst control
    - Backpressure handling
    - Performance characteristics (latency overhead, RPS capacity)
    - Graceful degradation under partial availability
    - Chaos engineering validation

!!! tip "Why It Matters"
    Agent workflows can trigger tool storms. Without proper controls, one runaway agent can exhaust backend capacity or blow through API quotas.

**ContextForge delivers:**

- Configurable retry policies per gateway/backend
- Per-tool timeout settings
- Built-in rate limiting with burst control
- Request throttling per user/team/tool
- Connection pooling and backpressure handling

| JSON Serialization | orjson (Rust-based) | 5-6x faster message processing |
| Connection Pooling | PgBouncer compatible | Handles thundering herd scaling |
| Caching | L1 (memory) + L2 (Redis) | Sub-millisecond tool schema lookups |

!!! example "Benchmark Targets for Evaluation"
    | Metric | Enterprise Requirement |
    |--------|----------------------|
    | Gateway Latency | <10ms (p95) |
    | Throughput | >350 RPS per instance |
    | Concurrent Users | 10,000+ per deployment |

---

    - LLM-specific metrics: token usage, prompt latency, tool error rates
    - Dashboard integration
    - Log aggregation with search
    - Health endpoints

!!! tip "Why It Matters"
    Agent-tool interactions are opaque without observability. Tracing and metrics convert black-box AI workflows into debuggable, optimizable systems.

**ContextForge delivers:**

- Native OpenTelemetry (OTLP) with W3C Trace Context propagation
- Backend support: Phoenix (LLM-focused), Jaeger, Zipkin, Arize, DataDog
- LLM metrics: token usage, prompt latency, tool error rates

=== "When Managed Makes Sense"

    - Rapid prototyping and MVPs
    - Teams without infrastructure expertise
    - Compliance requirements satisfied by vendor certifications

=== "When Self-Hosted Makes Sense"

    - Data sovereignty requirements
    - Deep customization needs
    - Cost optimization at scale
    - Air-gapped environments
    - Multi-cloud or hybrid deployments
